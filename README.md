# Constraints & Size Classes
It is an example where you can see implemented Constraints and Size Classes. In this way, you can see the advantages they have and how the screen adapts to different resolutions and devices.

## Examples

### Constraints
This example shows how to implement only Constraints. On the screen, you can see 4 images which adapt to different resolutions (iPhone & iPad + Portrait & Landscape).

### Constraints & Size Classes
This example is more complex than the previous one. We have only one ViewController, which adapts to different resolutions. Depending on what type of device (iPhone or iPad) and mode (landscape or Portrait), change:
- Location of components.
- Add or remove components.
- Type and size of the font.
- The pictures to show.
